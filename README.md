## 🧠 Objective

The final project aims to showcase my proficiency in coding and design by integrating the skills
acquired in the first semester and the latest knowledge gained during the second semester. I was
free to come up with my own ideas for the final project. I had a variety of choices, such as
creating an online store for any business, an app for a library, gym, streaming service, or any other
project as long as I followed the criteria and include the technical requirements. The key
requirement is that the project must be developed using React.
