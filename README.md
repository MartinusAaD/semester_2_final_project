# Noted errors/complications:

- In the product store page, no matter which /product-store/ path you enter, you always re-route to cherry-blossom as default.
- ScrollToTop in app could be a nuisance on pages with longer pages...



I was unsure wether to use a context or hook for the product retrieval... context might be too heave on the site considering the amount of products?
